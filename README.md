# LuaCraft
LuaCraft embeds LuaJ into Paper/Bukkit servers, providing developers with a lightweight, fast scripting layer without the complexity of full plugin development.
<br>
<br>
This is the original maintained repository of LuaCraft
# Requirements
LuaCraft requires Paper to be installed on the server, it does not support Spigot
<br>
<br>
LuaCraft currently supports 1.21.4+ and will intend to support this version and forward. The current projects scope does not intend to support lower versions than this.
<br>
<br>
LuaCraft soft depends on `Vault`
